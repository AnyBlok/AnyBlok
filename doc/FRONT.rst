http://pypi.python.org/pypi/anyblok.

Project Status
--------------

AnyBlok is currently in alpha status and is expected to be fairly
stable.   Users should take care to report bugs and missing features on an as-needed
basis.  It should be expected that the development version may be required
for proper implementation of recently repaired issues in between releases;
the latest master is always available at https://github.com/AnyBlok/AnyBlok/archive/master.zip.

`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ or a similar tool::

    pip install anyblok

..              <basedoc_tests>`.


To run framework tests with ``nose``::

    pip install nose
    nosetests anyblok/tests

To run tests of all installed bloks::

    anyblok_nose -c config.file.cfg

To run Blok tests during their installation::

AnyBlok is tested continuously using `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/AnyBlok/AnyBlok>`_

Dependencies
------------

AnyBlok works with **Python 3.4** and later. The install process will 
ensure that `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_, 
`Alembic <http://alembic.readthedocs.org/>`_,
`SQLAlchemy-Utils <http://sqlalchemy-utils.readthedocs.org/>`_ are installed, 
in addition to other dependencies.

AnyBlok works with SQLAlchemy from version **1.0.11**,
Alembic from version **0.8.4** and SQLAlchemy-Utils from version **0.31.4**.
The latest version of them is strongly recommended.
