  this attribute conflicts with the registry of AnyBlok. A new attribute 
  **anyblok** is created on the model to call the registry of AnyBlok. 
  A modification of the attribute **registry** is done to use both attributes
  with the same name. A deprecation warning is added on the attibute **registry**
  of AnyBlok

------------------

* Added Sequence with *no gap* to provide functional sequence without gaps.
* OrderList class_collection can be defined on x2Many

* Bug Fix on registry loading sequence. The **apply_model_schema_on_table**
  method called at registry initialisation has been splitted to make sqlalchemy
  ORM events registration independent from migration.
* Added undefined blok behaviour. It is an important behaviour needed and 
  written in the roadmap where the goal is to defined blok which need another
  inexisting blok. this blok is installabled only if the blok exist. A package
  can defined a group of bloks that depend of another packages. They bloks 
  are installabled if the another package is installed
* It is now possible to place a "Model" in another schema on the SGDB
  ::

      @registry(...)
      class MyModelInOtherSchema:
          __db_schema__ = 'my_schema'

* Now the Email, Selection, Country, Json, Decimal, Interval, LargeBinary 
  columns can be crypted
* Removed compatibility with **Python 3.4** and **python 3.5**, because 
  these versions are deprecated

  with cPython 

  * postgres: psycopg2-binary
  * mysql: mysqlclient
  * mariadb: mysqlclient
  * mssql: pymssql
  * pyodbc

* System.Parameter.get do not raise if a default value is provided
* Add ``--with-demo`` parameter while creating a database (anyblok_createdb) in
  order to load demo data while installing bloks on that database.
* Fixed issue #45: System.Sequence: inconsistency in 'number' field
* Fixed issue #134: is now possible to validate if the type at each part of foreign key
  are the same

-------------------

* Replaced the **nose test** by **pytest**. All the test was converted. 
* Moved and renamed ``anyblok.tests.testcase.py`` to ``anyblok.testing.py``. 
  The file ``anyblok.tests.testcase.py`` import only the TestCase class to
  continue to maintain the compatibility with older tests. PR
  `#67 <https://github.com/AnyBlok/AnyBlok/pull/67>`_
* the console script ``anyblok_nose`` raise an exception. Because this runner
  can't execute pytest tests. The goal is to use the nose plugin.
* Removed the behviour ``test-bloks-at-install``
* Added compatibility with `MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ and 
  `MariaDB <https://mariadb.org/>`_. PR `#85 <https://github.com/AnyBlok/AnyBlok/pull/85>`_

.. warning::

    this version can break unittest if the console script **anyblok_nose** is used

0.21.3 (2019-03-19)
-------------------

* Fixed issue #83, the name of constraint create by anyblok is truncated to check if the name is the same as the reflected name

0.21.2 (2019-03-18)
-------------------

* Fixed truncated constraint, the sqltext is different in function of the DB type

0.21.1 (2019-03-18)
-------------------

* Fixed pypi upload

0.21.0 (2019-03-15)
-------------------

* Fixed alias. The ``Model.aliased`` method now binds the registry to the alias. The goal is 
  to use **hybrid_method** with alias in AnyBlok.
* Fixed Column.Country, The latest version of pycountry does not raise a lookup exception
  When the countries does not exist. Now AnyBlok takes this change into consideration to raise the exception
  and keep the main behaviour
* Fixed alias. Now the ``Model.aliased`` method links the registry instance into the aliased model.
  The goal is to use `hybrid_method <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/hybrid.html#sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid.hybrid_method>`_ 
  decorator with alias in AnyBlok.
* Fixed #60: Now DateTime plugins verify also the DateTime columns of the dependencies of the Model
* Removed **Python 3.3** compatibility
* Improved the NoResultFound Exception for query.one and query.dictone. Now the registry name of the model
  is added to the exception's message
* Fixed compatitibility with **SQLAlchemy > 1.3**

0.20.0 (2018-09-10)
-------------------

* Refactor the plugins MODEL and VIEW to become factory, rename type attribute by factory
  attribute.

  .. warning::

      This new version does not break the compatibility, but
      deprecates older ways of registering SQL View Models.

      The version 1.0.0 of AnyBlok will remove these deprecated ways entirely.

      The new way to register SQL View Model is as follows::

            from anyblok.model.factory import ViewFactory

            @register(Model, factory=ViewFactory)
            class MyModel:
              ...

      whereas before version 0.19.2, it would have been::

            @register(Model, is_sql_view=True)
            class MyModel:
                ...

      and in version 0.19.3, it was::

            from anyblok.model.common import VIEW

            @register(Model, type=VIEW)
            class MyModel:
                ...

* issue #53: added primary join for mapping relationship of SQL views
  to themselves
* issue #54: on Blok methods
  ``pre_migration()``, ``post_migration()`` and ``update()`` the
  ``latest_version`` parameter is now instance
  of ``pkg_resources`` ``Version`` class, or ``None``
* new tests base class: SharedDataTestCase, allowing to share costly
  fixtures among tests of the same class
* scripts: removed useless and too magic ``need_blok``
* fixed Travis configuration for python 3.7
* plugins sytem optimization: removed stub implementations for all
  possible methods in base class (gives a substantial speedup in
  Travis tests).
* issue #55: Now, the **auto migration engine** of the Blok is entirely executed between
  ``pre_migration()`` and ``post_migration()``.

0.19.3 (2018-09-03)

  For each **DateTime** column the default timezone use is define by the order:

    1) default_timezone on column (if defined)
    2) default_timezone in configuration (if defined)
    3) timezone of the server

  .. warning:: 

      This options are only use for naive datetime, to save them with a timezone.
      In the case of a datetime with timezone, this datetime keep their own datetime.

* [IMP] add index constraint operation.
  Alembic declare now **add unique constraint**, the migration operation
  create the constraint on an existing and an unexisting columns
* [IMP] add index attibute on Many2One and One2One.
  Only when the column is created by the relationship Many2One or One2One.
  The column created get the attribute index gave to relationship and 
  apply it.
* [FIX] raise an ConfigurationException on wrong path
  if an inexisting configuration file is given the the exception is raised
* [REF] update **anyblok.start**
  The configuration is now loaded when configuration_group is none
* [ADD] **isolation_level** configuration
  The isolation level can be passed by **anyblok.start** or by the Configuration
  The default value is **READ_COMMITTED**, In the case or console script and
  Configuration add isolation level, the isolation used is always the isolation
  came from **anyblok.start**
* [REF] The nose plugins take the **tests** directories in any location in the blok
  not only at the root of the blok
* [REF] The options **test-blok-at-install** take the **tests** directory in any

  for many2many is not the same that primary key

0.16.0 (2018-01-25)
-------------------

* [REF] Json field, use the Json field from SQLAlchemy, because it
  is implemented by the db
* [FIX] check constraint on selection to get a name without number
  of entry

0.15.0 (2018-01-17)
-------------------

* [REF] column Selection add check constraint to forbid other
  value than the wanted

-------------------

* [REF] change log level, the instalation become less verbose
* [REF] change namimg convention, dont check in function of 
  table and column name to know if it is an AnyBlok constraint
* [FIX] check if a drop check constraint is not a add check constraint
  truncated
* [ADD] raise an exception if the primary changed, this action is too
  complexe to know how transform the relationship and keep the real
  value

0.13.0 (2018-01-09)
-------------------

* [FIX] check constraint must not be create at the same time that the column, 
  because the column of the constraint could have not exist yet

* [FIX] detect and apply add check constraint in the migration

0.12.2 (2018-01-04)
-------------------

* [FIX] name of the created class, before the fix anyblok use the tablename.
  In the case of polymorphism on single table, sqlalchemy found two two or more
  mappers for a single mapper name. Now the class name is the registry name 
  without dot.
  This change have consequence only if the primary join is forced.
  In the case::
      
      Test = registry.Test
      Test.id

  you need to change::

      primaryjoin = 'test.id == ...'

  by::
      
      primaryjoin = 'ModelTest.id == ...'

* [FIX] name of the fakecolumn when a Many2One is added whitout
  existing column names. This action allow to create two Many2One
  to the same remote Model.

  .. warning::

      This change have a big consequence on existing table, because a new column
      is added and the origin column is mark as unknown. You have to rename the column
      by SQL migration or add the column in Model or force the name in Many2One.

* [FIX] In the One2Many when two foreign keys found to the same primary key
  the primary join of the relation ship is now a ``or_`` not a ``and_``
* [FIX] One2Many detect also the Many2One to get the FakeColumn to do primary join
