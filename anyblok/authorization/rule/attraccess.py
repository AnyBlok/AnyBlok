        The ``model_rule`` allows to express conveniently that some
        principal has a "general" Read right on some model,
        while still allowing it to read only some of the
        records, and to protect the querying by the same
        'Read' permission. Similar and finer effects can
        be obtained by creating a separate 'Search' permission, but that may
        not be appropriate in a given context.
